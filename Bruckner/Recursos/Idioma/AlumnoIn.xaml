    <sys:String x:Key="Text1">In the 19th century, most rural school teachers lived in modest circumstances.
    </sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text2">As well as a meagre salary, they also received some payment in kind, including free accommodation in the school building. In addition to their teaching duties in the single classes which sometimes comprised ninety or more pupils, teachers also had to organise church services and run small farms to supplement their paltry pay.
    </sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text3">Education was compulsory until the age of twelve, and the curriculum included reading, writing, arithmetic and religion. Its stated objective was the religious and moral education of pupils.

    <sys:String x:Key="Text4">The prerequisite for being admitted as a teacher was to attend a Lehrerbildungsanstalt (teacher training institution), known as Präparandie. Candidates had to be at least 16 years old and pass an entrance exam.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text5">In Bruckner's time, training at the Präparandie lasted ten months and included spelling, reading, language, geography, religion, arithmetic, handwriting, and music. Attendance at daily Mass was mandatory, with festive days often accompanied by student music.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text6">The music curriculum included harmony, figured bass, choral singing, and organ. Upon successful completion of the training, the student was appointed as a junior teacher, and after several years of experience, they could be promoted to a regular teacher.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text7">The music teacher Johann August Dürrnberger (1800-1880) may have had a lasting impact on Bruckner. Dürrnberger was a central figure in the musical life of Linz; he was a composer and published a fundamental book on harmony and figured bass in 1841 (Elementar-Lehrbuch der Harmonie- und Generalbaßlehre).</sys:String>
