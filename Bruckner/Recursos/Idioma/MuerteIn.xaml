    <sys:String x:Key="Title">death and last wishes</sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text1">„You must understand, Gentlemen, that here in St. Florian, where I have always been so happy since my youth, […] is where I want to be laid to rest, below the large organ which I have played so much during my life, and which was always my friend“

    <sys:String x:Key="Text2">[August Göllerich/Max Auer, Anton Bruckner.]</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text3">Bruckner suffered from a heart problem, complaining of dropsy and breathlessness as early as 1892. That year, he visited the Wagner Festival in Bayreuth for the last time, and on 28 October 1892, was relieved of his position at the Hofmusikkapelle at his own request.

    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text4">After his health deteriorated further during 1893, he experienced a surprising improvement towards the end of the year. In December 1894, he suffered a major relapse and the doctors had already given up on him, when his health once again took a turn for the better.

    </sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text5">He continued to work on his Ninth Symphony, which he hoped to complete.

    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text6">But Bruckner's wish remained unfulfilled as he died at 3:30 pm on 11 October 1896 in his apartment in Kustodentrakt at Schloss Belvedere.
    </sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="Text7">The body remained at his home for three days to allow friends and admirers to bid farewell.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text8">To decorate the room, Emperor Franz Joseph I sent a floral arrangement from the Court's garden.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text9">Even while alive, Bruckner had thought about his final resting place. According to his wishes, his circle of life was to end where his artistic and personal journey had begun: at the St. Florian monastery, preferably beneath his beloved organ. Bruckner, who had expressed his last wishes in a will, had addressed the abbot of St. Florian about this matter in 1885 and had reiterated his wishes during his final visit to St. Florian at Easter in 1894.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text10">As an alternative, Bruckner considered being buried in the cemetery of the Steyr parish church. He would only reluctantly have accepted being buried in Vienna:</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text11">“If the people of Steyr will not accept me, then the people of Vienna will have me, in the name of God.” [August Göllerich/Max Auer, Anton Bruckner. A Life and Work Portrait.]</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text12">The transfer of the remains from Vienna to St. Florian was done by rail.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text13">According to current hygiene regulations, the body had to be embalmed for transport, a process for which Bruckner had already arranged in 1893 with the guarantee of Dr. Richard Paltauf (1858-1924).</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text14">Since no request was made for a grave in the Vienna Central Cemetery, the Vienna municipal council decided to cover the costs of a high-class funeral, known as Pracht-Classe (class of excellence).</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text15">The solemn funeral procession, with a six-horse hearse, first went on October 14, 1896, to the Church of St. Charles Borromeo for the blessing and then to the West Station (Westbahnhof).</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text16">Among the attendees were numerous personalities from the city's cultural and musical life.</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="Text17">During a solemn ceremony with a large public participation, the remains were interred in the monastery church crypt, right beneath the organ.</sys:String>
